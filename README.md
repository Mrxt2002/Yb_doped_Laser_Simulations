# Supercontinuum Generation in Photonic Crystal Fiber

![Supercontinuum Generation](images/supercontinuum.png)

## Overview

This repository explores the phenomenon of supercontinuum generation in photonic crystal fibers (PCFs), focusing on Power Spectral Density (PSD) variations and optical rogue waves (RWs) formation under different pumping conditions. It includes MATLAB simulations and experimental data analysis to validate theoretical models against practical results.

## Key Features

- **PSD Analysis:** Collaborated with PhD students to analyze PSD variations along the fiber input using MATLAB simulations. Implemented iterative averaging and direct computation methods for accurate PSD normalization.
  
- **Visualization:** Utilized logarithmic scale plots and video format to visualize PSD trends across iterations. Animation frames were employed to illustrate dynamic changes over various wavelength ranges.

- **Optical Rogue Waves:** Investigated RWs in nonlinear optical fibers using Gaussian spectrum models. Compared and validated models against experimental supercontinuum spectra to refine predictions under different pumping scenarios.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/supercontinuum.git
   cd supercontinuum
   ```

2. Install MATLAB and required toolboxes.

3. Explore the `scripts/` directory for MATLAB scripts related to PSD analysis and RW simulations.

4. Refer to the `data/` directory for experimental datasets and simulation results.

## Usage

### PSD Analysis

Run `psd_analysis.m` to perform Power Spectral Density analysis along the PCF input. Adjust parameters and visualize results using MATLAB plotting functions.

```matlab
% Example code snippet
load('experimental_data.mat');
[psd, frequencies] = calculate_psd(data);
plot_psd(frequencies, psd);
```

### Optical Rogue Waves Simulation

Use `rw_simulation.m` to simulate optical rogue waves formation under different pumping conditions. Compare results with theoretical models and experimental data.

```matlab
% Example code snippet
results = simulate_rw(pump_parameters);
visualize_rw(results);
```
